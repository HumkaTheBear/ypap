name: Bruce
gender: Male
age: 2-3
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 25
breed: Mixed
arrival date: 2016-09-30
notes: Bruce is one of the staff and volunteers' all-time favorite dogs! He is a big softy-very gentle and well-behaved with people. He does well with dogs that he knows and has been socialized with, but will need an experienced handler and time warming up to new and unfamiliar dogs. He is also not too keen on cats, so a home without them would be required. We are all desperate for Bruce to go to a foster or forever home. He really needs to get out of the pound environment.

name: Hooch
gender: Male
age: 2
spayed/neutered: Yes
weight: 20
breed: Jindo Mix
arrival date: 2016-01-02
notes: Hooch is a big boy with lots of love to give. He’ll need some care and patience as he learns to be an inside dog. BUT Jindos are super smart and with some attention and training I’m sure he’ll learn to be the companion he wants to be. Hooch does very well living together with other dogs. He can get super excited by others when he’s on the leash so you’ll have to hang on tight while he learns how to walk like a gentleman. We love his bright brown eyes, big smile, and his lopsided ears.

name: Merlin
gender: Male
age: 2
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 25
breed: Pitbull
arrival date: 2016-03-28
notes: Meet Merlin! We don’t know for sure, but because he is a pitbull, we assume Merlin was used as a fighting dog before. He is strong and energetic and has been known to lunge at other dogs that pass by him. He is very friendly with women but we need to test him with men and children. He always wags his tail for the staff and turns around to ask for a nice butt scratch. Merlin will need an experienced owner and someone that will work on his manners.

name: Eddie
gender: Male
age: 1
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 30
breed: Pitbull
arrival date: 2016-08-23
notes: It is most likely that Eddie here lived on a heavy chain and was a victim of cruelty. He was probably neglected, used, and treated like property for people’s entertainment in dog fights. Many people don’t understand, but the dogs in fighting rings are no different than any other dog. Eddie wants to be happy. He wants to give back. What he wants to do is love. Eddie will certainly need an experienced owner and trainer who is willing to work with him and his trauma.

name: Bob
gender: Male
age: 4
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 20
breed: Mixed
arrival date: 2016-09-20
notes: This is Bob. Bob has been in the pound for much too long all because he is a big black mutt dog. Although he doesn’t seem terribly bothered by the pound environment, it’s still time for him to het a home. He’s lived a long time without a loving owner and is hoping for somebody who will accept him for who he is, flaws and all. Bob came in with a limp in his hind legs, assumed from an old injury that didn’t heal properly. Bob has tested heartworm positive and will need to undergo treatment.

name: Lena
gender: Female
age: 2
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 25
breed: Jindo Mix
arrival date: 2016-02-07
notes: Meet Lena! She has a beautiful gold coat and white nose with eyes that just sparkle. She really stands out as quite a gorgeous girl. She has been overlooked at the pound time and time again, though she is an absolute doll. Lena would make a wonderful companion. She’s a country girl though and will probably need a little patience learning to live in a home. She would love to be pampered and spoiled and leaver her past all behind her.

name: Norbert
gender: Male
age: 1
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 20
breed: Mixed
arrival date: 2016
notes: This is Norbert. He likes to be around other dogs as they help him feel less alone. He likes people too, but gets nervous when people ask him to come out of his cage. In spite of the suffering he’s been through, he is still happy for attention, as long as you are slow and gentle. He is hoping that a patient someone will see fit to give him a loving home. He will need another dog in the home to help him understand that he’s safe.

name: Zandra
gender: Female
age: 
spayed/neutered: No
weight: 15
breed: Jindo
arrival date: 2016-03-23
notes: Meet Zandra. She came into the pound rail thin and without much energy. She has slowly been gaining weight, but really what she needs is regular exercise to build up her muscles. It’s likely she has lived most of her life on a chain and has never been the strong healthy girl she should be. At the pound she is quiet and reserved, not excited by much. She is so bored and lonely and never been shown what doggie life should be like. We would love to see this pretty girl with a loving family.
