                <p class="title">Cleaning</p>

                <p>Anyone living locally, please join us at the pound in Yongin City, about 45 minutes outside of Seoul. 
                    You don’t have to have experience, all you need is common sense and a love of animals! 
                    The reward you will feel from helping an animal will be guaranteed to stay with you forever.
                </p>

                <p>Every month we organize volunteer trips to clean the pound. We rely heavily on volunteers 
                    to make the life of the animals more comfortable.
                </p>

                <p>Additionally, our goal is to spread the word about the dogs and get them adopted!</p>

                <p>When volunteers come see and spend time with the animals they are more likely to share their photos and information. 
                    Please help us find homes for the dogs by telling your friends, family, and coworkers about animals they may be interested in.
                </p> 

                <b>Cleaning sessions usually last between 10am to 1pm.</b>

                <p>See about our latest cleaning session on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ForBonnies/">FACEBOOK</a>.</p>

                <p class="title">Driving</p>
                <p>YPAP is always seeking drivers to assist with transporting dogs around the Seoul area.</p>
                <p>We need drivers who can help us transport dogs from the pound to foster homes, to the vet, and sometimes to the airport.</p>
                <p>If you have a valid driving license and would be willing to help, please <a>Contact Us</a>.</p>

                <p class="title">Administration</p>
                <p>YPAP takes a lot of time and energy to run!</p>

                <p>We are looking for people who can help us process and organize the foster and adoption applications, as well as arranging pound visits, fundraising, or volunteer sessions.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in getting involved in the admin side of YPAP, please <a>Contact Us.</a></p>

                <p class="title">Courier</p>
                <p>Couriers are people flying internationally who are willing to check in a dog under their name at the airport.</p>
                <p>The pound will arrange everything and there is <b>no cost</b> to you.</p>
                <p>Usually only <b>DIRECT</b> flights work for sending an animal on a plane due to long flight times and airline regulations.</p>
                <p>If you are not flying direct, please let us know and we can try to arrange a dog to fly IN CABIN with you, under the seat.</p>
                <p>Most commonly we need flights to SFO, LAX, JFK, SEA, ORD, IAD, YVR, YYZ, VIE, MUC.</p>
                <p>If you are flying in the future, please <a>Contact Us.</a></p>

                <p class="title">Other Opportunities</p>
                <p>You may also chose to raise funds for a specific mission or do a general fundraiser in support of the dogs in Korea.</p>

                <p>You can do a simple fundraiser or use an upcoming activity or event. Many YPAP supporters raise funds by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running a marathon or participating in another sporting event.</li>
                    <li>Selling homemade cookies.</li>
                    <li>“Giving up” their birthday and asking their birthday and asking friends and family to make a donation in lieu of a gift.</li>
                    <li>Establishing a virtual wedding registry with wedding gifts given in the form of donations.</li>
                    <li>Or most often simply telling YPAP’s story and asking friends and family to join in helping the dogs.</li>
                </ul>
